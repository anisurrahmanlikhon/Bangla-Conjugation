# Bangla-Conjugation
## Welcome
Welcome to Bangla-Tangla! This site contains some tools and resources that I have been developing while learning the Bengali (Bangla) language. Use the menu at the top of the page to navigate the site. If you ever want to get back to this page just click on the title at the top of the page.

## Bangla Fonts and Keyboard
This site has embedded Bangla fonts that should work on most systems. Exceptions include systems that don't support Bangla fonts at all (eg, Windows Phone 7), and older browsers and operating systems.

The Bangla-Tangla dictionary allows you to look up Bangla words using roman characters, but to search for words more precisely you'll need a way to input Bangla characters. This usually involves installing keyboard software that maps the keys on your English keyboard to Bangla characters. The popular Avro keyboard allows phonetic typing on Windows, MacOS and Linux. For Android I recommend the Ridmik keyboard. For typing Bangla explicitly, I use the Probhat keyboard on Linux and Windows, and the built-in Bangla-QWERTY keyboard on MacOS. In a pinch, you can type into Avro.im or use gmail's Bangla input system, and then cut and paste the word as needed.
